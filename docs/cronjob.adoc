## Scheduled tasks

A couple of tasks must be scheduled daily for Sous-Chef to work as expected.

### Orders generation

Orders can be generated days in advance for episodic and ongoing clients, according to their meal defaults.
This allows a better and simpler administration.

To generate orders 30 days in advance, run the following script:

 docker exec -it souschef_web_1 python souschef/manage.py generateorders <date> --days 30

Cronjob version:

 @daily /usr/bin/docker exec -it souschef_web_1 python souschef/manage.py generateorders $(date +%Y-%m-%d) --days 30

Note that existing orders won't be overriden by this script.

### Delivered Orders

Orders that have been successfully delivered must be updated to reflect that.

Every day, the *Ordered* orders are delivered. Once they are, they should pass to the *Delivered* status,
which will allow the billing system to work properly.

### Backup

To run a database backup, one option is to run the following command (using here the default credentials):

 docker exec -it souschef_db_1 mysqldump -uroot -p123456 feast > souschef_data.sql

Cronjob version:

 @daily /usr/bin/docker exec -it souschef_db_1 mysqldump -uroot -p123456 feast > souschef_data_$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
